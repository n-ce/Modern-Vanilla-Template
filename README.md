# Modern Vanilla Template (MVT)

This project is a modern HTML template designed for creating dynamic web content using a compact, array-based component system. It focuses on simplicity, efficiency, and no dependencies.

## Features

* **Array-Based Component System:**
    * Creates HTML elements using a concise array syntax: `['tag', { attributes }, [children]]`.
    * Supports boolean and value-based attributes.
    * Handles document fragments when no tag is provided.
* **Minimalistic Approach:**
    * Relies solely on vanilla JavaScript, no external libraries or frameworks required.
    * Lightweight and performant.
* **Modern CSS Reset:**
    * Includes a modern CSS reset based on Jake Lazaroff's recommendations, ensuring consistent styling across browsers.
* **CSS Nesting:**
    * Uses CSS nesting for cleaner and more organized styles.
* **Data Fetching:**
    * Fetches data from a JSON API (`https://dummyjson.com/todos`) and dynamically renders it.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Provides basic error handling for fetch requests.
* **No Build Tools Required:**
    * Start editing directly in your browser.

## Getting Started

**Option 1: Clone the Repository (Recommended for Git Users)**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    * If you're using Git, you can clone the repository to your local machine.

**Option 2: Direct Download and Edit**

1.  **Download `index.html`:**
    * Download the `index.html` file directly to your local machine.
2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    * Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  **Start Editing:**
    * Open the `index.html` file in your favorite text editor and begin making changes. You can directly modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Component Syntax

The component system uses the following array-based syntax:

* `['tag', { attributes }, [children]]`
    * `tag`: The HTML tag name (e.g., `'div'`, `'h1'`, `'p'`).
    * `attributes`: An object containing element attributes (e.g., `{ class: 'my-class', open: true }`).
    * `children`: An array of child elements or text nodes.

**Example:**

```javascript
['div', { class: 'my-container' }, [
  ['h1', {}, ['Hello, World!']],
  ['p', {}, ['This is a paragraph.']]
]]
```

**Document Fragments:**

To create a document fragment (a group of elements without a parent element), omit the `tag`:

```javascript
[
  ['p', {}, ['First paragraph']],
  ['p', {}, ['Second paragraph']]
]
```

## Attribute Handling

* Boolean attributes are handled using `toggleAttribute`.
* Value-based attributes are handled using `setAttribute`.
* Falsy attribute values will cause the attribute to be removed.

## Data Fetching

The template fetches todo items from the `https://dummyjson.com/todos` API and renders them dynamically.

## CSS

* The CSS includes a modern reset and custom styles for the todo items.
* CSS nesting is used for improved organization.

## Customization

* You can customize the CSS to change the appearance of the todo items.
* You can modify the JavaScript to fetch data from different APIs or to render different types of components.
* You can change the component structure and or add new components.

## Notes

* This template is designed for learning and experimentation, and is best suited for simple and small projects.
* It provides a foundation for building basic web applications using a single HTML file.
* The `if (typeof content[0] === string && content.length === 3)` check is used to validate the component structure.
* The `if (attributes[key])` check is used to differentiate between boolean attributes and attributes that require values.
